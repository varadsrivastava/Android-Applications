For the dressing, whisk the garlic and oil together in a bowl.
Place the eggs into a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring up to the boil, switch off the heat and leave for five minutes. Cool under a cold running tap for 2-3 minutes and then peel the eggs.
For the salad, arrange all of the salad ingredients (except the chervil and basil) in a shallow dish. Pour over the vinegar and garlic oil and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Finish with a sprinkling of chervil and basil and serve at the table.
