Put all of the ingredients for the bone broth in a large lidded pot and cover with cold water. The water level should cover the bones by 5cm/2in while still leaving room at the top of the pan. Cover and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for at least 6 hours for chicken and 12 for beef or lamb, skimming off any foam that rises to the top. Strain the liquid and return to the pot, set aside.
Cook the buckwheat noodles according to the packet instructions, using plenty of water. During the first minute of cooking, use two forks to stir and separate the noodles.
