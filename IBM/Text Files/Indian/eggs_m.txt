Heat the oil and butter in a small non-stick frying pan. Add the onion and fry for about four minutes, until soft.
Beat together the rest of the ingredients in a bowl and pour into the pan and scramble as normal. Take them off the heat when they are cooked to your taste. Serve with toast or naan bread.
