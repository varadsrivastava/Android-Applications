
For the mayo, blend the egg yolks, white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, anchovy fillets and paprika to a smooth paste in a food processor.
With the motor still running, gradually add the oil in a thin stream, until the mixture thickens to a smooth mayonnaise.
For the chicken nuggets, heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 180C/350F. Alternatively, heat the oil in a deep, heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)
In a large bowl, mix together the flours and the bicarbonate of soda.
Gradually pour in the sparkling water in a thin stream, whisking well until the mixture comes together as a loose, smooth batter.
Sprinkle a little semolina flour onto a plate. Dust the chicken pieces in the flour, then dip them into the batter.
Carefully lower the chicken nuggets into the hot oil, in batches if necessary, and fry until the batter turns crisp and golden-brown, and the nuggets float to the surface of the oil (about 3-4 minutes). Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. Just before serving, dust the chicken nuggets with the cayenne pepper and sprinkle over the sea salt flakes.
To serve, place equal amounts of chicken nuggets into serving bowls with a dollop of mayo alongside.
